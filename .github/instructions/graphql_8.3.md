# GraphQL Server Implementation Guide (Part 8: a GraphQL-server)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Implement a **Node.js** server using **GraphQL** and **Apollo Server** to serve data via a single, flexible API endpoint, shifting from the traditional REST resource-based philosophy.

***

## 1. Project Setup and Dependencies

The agent must set up a new Node.js project and install the necessary libraries:
1.  Initialize a new Node project: `npm init -y`
2.  Install **Apollo Server** and the core **GraphQL** package:
    ```bash
    npm install @apollo/server graphql
    ```
3.  Create an entry file, typically `index.js`, for the server logic.

***

## 2. Define the GraphQL Schema (Type Definitions)

Define the structure of the data and the operations clients can perform. This is done using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL).

1.  **Define Types:** Create types for data entities (e.g., `Person`, `Book`).
    * Example:
        ```graphql
        type Person {
          name: String!
          phone: String
          street: String!
          city: String!
          id: ID!
        }
        ```
    * **Key Syntax:** Use `type` for custom objects, standard **Scalar Types** (`String`, `Int`, `Boolean`, `ID`), and `!` to denote a **non-nullable** field.

2.  **Define the Query Type:** Define the read operations available to the client.
    * Example:
        ```graphql
        type Query {
          personCount: Int!
          allPersons: [Person!]!
          findPerson(name: String!): Person
        }
        ```

***

## 3. Implement Resolvers

Implement the functions that execute the logic for each field defined in the schema. Resolvers connect the GraphQL query to the actual data source (e.g., an in-memory array, a database, or another REST API).

1.  Create a `resolvers` object where the functions match the names defined under `Query` (and later `Mutation` and `Subscription`).
2.  The resolver for `allPersons` must return a list of `Person` objects.
3.  The resolver for a query with arguments (e.g., `findPerson(name: String!)`) must accept a second parameter, `args`, to access the input values (e.g., `args.name`).

***

## 4. Initialize and Start the Apollo Server

Combine the schema and resolvers to start the server.

1.  Import `ApolloServer`, the `typeDefs` (schema), and the `resolvers`.
2.  Initialize a new `ApolloServer` instance:
    ```javascript
    const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
    ```
3.  Use the `startStandaloneServer` function to run the server, making it accessible via HTTP (typically on a `/graphql` endpoint).

***

## 5. Implement Mutations (Data Modification)

To allow clients to modify data (create, update, delete), the agent must:

1.  **Extend the Schema:** Add a `Mutation` type to `typeDefs`.
    * Define input fields for the mutation and the return type.
    * Example: `addPerson(name: String!, phone: String, street: String!, city: String!): Person`
2.  **Implement Mutation Resolvers:** Add a `Mutation` field to the `resolvers` object.
    * The resolver logic must handle saving the new data and then return the newly created object (or the fields requested by the client).

***

## 6. Implement Subscriptions (Real-time Updates)

For real-time functionality (if required by the client), the agent should:

1.  **Introduce a PubSub (Publish-Subscribe) Mechanism:** Use a library (like `graphql-subscriptions` or similar) to manage event publishing.
2.  **Extend the Schema:** Add a `Subscription` type to `typeDefs`.
    * Example: `personAdded: Person!`
3.  **Implement Subscription Resolver:** The resolver should return an **Async Iterator** that listens for events from the PubSub system.
4.  **Publish Events:** Within the relevant `Mutation` resolver (e.g., `addPerson`), call the PubSub's `publish` method to notify all subscribers of the new event.
